In this task, approximate the square root of a floating point number x without using the power operator or a package. Rather, you should use the Newton’s method. Start with an initial guess for the square root called z0. You then repeatedly improve it using the following formula, until the difference between some previous guess zi and the next zi+1 is less than some threshold, say 0.01 \n",
