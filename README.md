# Emerging_Technology

## Introduction
This README.md file is a navigation guide for my Emerging Technology assignment where I have been given 4 tasks and a project in which I explore Deutch's Algorithm. 
## Overview
This Github page was created using a Juypter notebook to complete tasks and explore the assignment of Deutch's Algorithm which also explores Quantum Computing to gain a better understanding of how the algorithm works. Through this assignment, I also have a much clearer understanding of what Quantum Computing is and the ground-breaking capabilities it has.
## Getting Started
Getting started with this assignment I recommend installing the following
* Python version 3. x
* Jupyter Notebook
* Qiskit

### Python Download
1. Visit [Python.org](https://www.python.org/ "Python.org")
2. Download the latest version of Python to your machine. When writing this the most recent version was 3.12.1
3. Run the installer. Ensure that you check the box that says "Add Python 3. x to PATH" before you click "Install Now" 

### Jupyter Download
1. Open the command line or terminal 
2. Install the classic Jupyter Notebook using pip by running
`pip install notebook`
3. Run Notebook.
`jupyter notebook`

### Qiskit Download
1. Open the command line or terminal
2. Install Qiskit using pip by running
`pip install qiskit`
